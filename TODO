TODO List
=========

API design
----------

- rationalize the parameter names.  For example, does the "plot" in
  "plot_point_col" make sense?
- be more systematic about the order of arguments
- swap the row/column arguments of Canvas.subplot()?
  Or use a two-dimensional argument to select the subplot?
- set up graphics parameters so that `ax.draw_...(..., style=dict(col='red'))`
  works as expected
- reconsider the split between "param.py" and "util.py"

bug fixes
---------

- move the labels for color bars to the right by default?

enhancements
------------

- if values are integers, prefer integer-valued labels
- allow for the data to go slightly beyond the outermost axis labels
  (e.g. a histogram of {-1, 0, 1}-valued data should not label -2)
- Should the box centers or the box boundaries be labeled in histograms?
- pixel-align the axis box (and maybe the tick marks?)
- autogenerate doc-strings for configuration parameters
- in the parameter descriptions, be clear whether dimensions are
  widths or half-widths.
- implement logarithmic axes
- add support for custom tick label formats, e.g. for dates.
  In "demo2.py" use multiples of pi for the x-axis labels.
- Choose a nicer style for the sphinx HTML output.
- implement box plots
- make it easy to label the lines created by `draw_affine()`
- add support for embedded figure legends
- allow to draw several lines in one call to `draw_affine`
- can we get away with only keeping the changed keys in `param.update`?
- add support for images with 1 or 4 channels
- implement minor axis ticks
- Implement units 'em' and 'en'.  Relative font sizes can be easily
  implemented using the parent_height argument of param.get().  But
  what are the font sizes relative to?
