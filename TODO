API design
----------

- swap the row/column arguments of Canvas.subplot()?
  Or use a two-dimensional argument to select the subplot?
- don't use `rect` for data coordinates.  Use x_lim and y_lim
  instead (e.g. in `Axes.draw_image()`).
- swap the arguments of `draw_image`
- rationalize the parameter names.  For example, does the "plot" in
  "plot_point_col" make sense?
- reconsider the split between "param.py" and "util.py"
- be more systematic about the order of arguments

bug fixes
---------

- pixel-align the axis box (and maybe the tick marks?)

enhancements
------------

- add a new command to plot "bands"
- implement logarithmic axes
- add support for custom tick label formats, e.g. for dates.
  In "demo2.py" use multiples of pi for the x-axis labels.
- implement minor axis ticks
- implement units 'em' and 'en'
- Relative font sizes can be easily implemented using the
  parent_height argument of param.get().  But what are the font sizes
  relative to?
- Should the box centers or the box boundaries be labelled in histograms?
- Choose a nicer style for the sphinx HTML output.
- implement box plots
- if one of the functions which create axes (e.g. `Canvas.plot()`) is
  called a second time, switch to a new page?
- make it easy to label the lines created by `draw_affine()`
- add support for embedded figure legends
- if values are integers, prefer integer-valued labels
- add a function to draw color bars
- allow to draw several lines in one call to `draw_affine`
- can we get away with only keeping the changed keys in `param.update`?
- autogenerate doc-strings for configuration parameters
- add support for images with 1 or 4 channels
