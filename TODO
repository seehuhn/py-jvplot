API design
----------

- swap the row/column arguments of Canvas.subplot()?
  Or use a two-dimensional argument to select the subplot?
- rename x_lim -> xlim and y_lim -> ylim for compatibility with R?
- make plotting of border, ticks and tick labels optional
- replace `viewport` with a new function to draw an empty set
  of axes

bug fixes
---------

- if the right/top-most tick label does not fit within the padding,
  move the label inwards a bit.
- autogenerate doc-strings for configuration parameters
- Maybe axis tick labels should use the same number of digits
  throughout, not 0.38, 0.385, 0.39?
- pixel-align the axis box (and maybe the tick marks?)
- use `draw_text` or a similar function to draw all labels.
- use "*-padding-*" style parameters instead of `_spread()`

enhancements
------------

- add a new command to plot "bands"
- implement logarithmic axes
- add support for custom tick label formats, e.g. for dates
- add support for axis labels
- implement minor axis ticks
- add support for raster images
- implement units 'em' and 'en'
- Relative font sizes can be easily implemented using the
  parent_height argument of param.get().  But what are the font sizes
  relative to?
- Should histograms have padding-bottom = 0?
- Should the box centers or the box boundaries be labelled in histograms?
- Choose a nicer style for the sphinx HTML output.
- implement box plots
- if one of the functions which create axes (e.g. `Canvas.plot()`) is
  called a second time, switch to a new page
- allow to place axis labels along all four edges of a plot
- make it easy to label the lines created by `draw_affine()`
- add support for different line styles
- add support for embedded figure legends
